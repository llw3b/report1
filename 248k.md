For example, i drop productivity module into ki's beacons, and it works . when i remove any ki beacon or remove/change ki core ,all of the modules in beacons are cleared . also, the modules dropped into beacon and core will not return after mining.
On the contrary, for expample, if i never desconstruct them， i can get a productivity +1000% and more rocket silo.
It looks insame. is that work properly？
